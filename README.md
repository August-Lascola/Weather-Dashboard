## INTRODUCTION
---------------
The weather dashboard is a simple app that allows the user to input a destination and be presented with basic weather information from the desired destination. 

## REQUIREMENTS
--------------
N/A


## FUNCTIONALITY
----------------
The live site for the application can be found at: https://august-lascola.github.io/Weather-Dashboard/
Upon loading the page, the user will be met with a search bar to input a destination. The project is currently incomplete as I couldn't get the API call to work.

For the future, there will be a responsive UI and the user will be able to view a weather icon corresponding to the current weather, and will also be able to save their previously searched destinations.
